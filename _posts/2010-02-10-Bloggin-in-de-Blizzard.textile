h2. I've been bitchin' for some time ...

... about hating my blog tools. Just to write something technical I end up using several different tools, none of which are aimed at solving _my_ problem. However, after hooking into Jekyll, and using Eclipse/Mylin Wikitext I'm finding some happiness.  :-)

When I told my buddy Marc Esher about using Eclipse to blog, he was curious to know what the workflow looked like. So, I put together this short screencast (in which I sound retarded because it was the first thing I did this morning and hadn't had but a half a cup of coffee). Anyway, this is what's been working for me lately. 

This isn't about setup and configuration (there's plenty of info about that). This is about workflow. But, at the bottom is a list of the tools I use.
