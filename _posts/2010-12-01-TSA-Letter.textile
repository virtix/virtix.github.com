To whom it may concern,

I understand and support the need for safe travel in United States as well as human rights of people everywhere.  As with many Americans, I’ve also read the accounts of numerous dissatisfied travelers.  Valid or not these are clearly problems for the travel industry and moral of the American people.  These problems also bring into question the effectiveness of the security measures in currently in place.

I’d like to present an idea for your consideration.  This idea does not need to leverage any new technology (which I whole heartedly support), but should complement the existing screening system and leverages psychology and the inherent human instincts of fear and intimidation.  I’m not suggesting armed military personnel at every turn; but rather, I suggest a trusted, familiar American heroic figure: Chuck Norris.

Why?

1.      It’s a known fact that images of Chuck Norris will create observable agitation in terrorists.  This can be an effective screening measure prior to x-rays.

2.      Chuck Norris’s voice should also be translated in many languages and be broadcasted as simple messages to passengers waiting in line.  The mere sound of his voice has been proven to create observable agitation in terrorists.

3.      TV commercials featuring Chuck Norris as the key spokesperson for the TSA will, in many cases, simply deter terrorists and bring a sense of protection and calm to passengers.

4.      In highly targeted areas, such as Washington DC, an animated holographic image of Chuck Norris performing a roundhouse kick at or near screening areas will surely create an effective detterent against terrorism as well as provide a sense of protection and authority.

5.      True, it’s also know that that some images of Chuck Norris cause young children to cry, but this may be an acceptable risk.  (Further studies should be conducted to determine the impact of Chuck Norris images on infants)

6.      Posters of Chuck Norris should be placed throughout US airports.  Similar billboards on thoroughfares near airports could present similar images.  Perhaps a simple easy-to-remember slogan should be on each poster or billboard; E.g., “There is no chin behind my beard.  Only another fist.”


The TSA is likely to have a fixed budget, but in light of this travel and security crisis, the cost and implementation time for a TSA Chuck Norris Campaign will likely be nominal compared to implementing advanced and broad high-tech security options. 

I thank you for your time, consideration, and public service.
