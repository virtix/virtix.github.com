I am somewhat visual, and I like a good graphic to represent information, ideas, and concepts. But creating, resizing, and uploading images is slow for blogging. What I want to do is grab an image (a screen shot, for example), include a thumbnail in a blog post and when the reader clicks it, it opens up a nice modal dialog. With CSS we can automatically size the image down as the page loads, which is nice. But we also want to the reader to be able to view the full size image. 

My solution&mdash;I would like to hear others&mdash;is to write the image's URL into my textile document with a CSS style attribute, specifying the desired thumbnail (240px wide, for example). Now, I  need a way to view the full image. Thanks to Jack's "ColorBox":http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/ I can display a very nice modal dialog of a thumbnail. The textile source looks something like this: @!(tn200)/images/Screenshot-1.png!@ Where '!' specifies an image in textile and @(tn200)@ is a CSS style.

TheCSS and  JQuery code to execute the ColorBox modal dialog is simple, too:

<pre class="brush:  html">
<style>
.tn200{ width:200px }
</style>

<script>
$().ready(function(){
	 $('.tn100,.tn200,.tn300').colorbox( {
			title: function(){ return '<a href="' + $(this).attr('src') + '">View Original</a>' },
			href: function(){ return  $(this).attr('src')  },
			transition: 'elastic',
			maxHeight:840,
			maxWidth:1180
       }); 
 });
</script>
</pre>
@this@ refers to the image object. Full raw "textile":http://github.com/virtix/virtix.github.com/raw/master/_posts/2010-02-20-Thumbnail-Modal-Dialog.textile of this blog post.


h3. Some Examples

240px wide thumbnail opening full size image in a modal dialog:

!(tn200)/images/Screenshot-1.png!

<br />

320px wide thumbnail opening a full size image in a modal dialog:
!(tn300)/images/DestroyTwitter.png! 

<br />

120px wide thumbnail opening a full size image in a modal dialog from Photobucket:
!(tn100){{ site.images }}/back_to_school.jpg!


300px wide thumbnail opening a full size image in a _browser_ window. This is an alternative to modal dialogs and might be good for large or hi-res images:
!(tn)/images/Screenshot-2.png!:/images/Screenshot-2.png


h4. Quick Summary

Once set up with "JQuery":http://jquery.org and "ColorBox":http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/, I can now load images from Photobucket or locally and use the following to automatically generate a thumbnail that displays in a very nice modal dialog:

@!(tn200)/images/Screenshot-1.png!@
