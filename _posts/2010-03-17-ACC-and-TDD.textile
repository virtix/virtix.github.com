h2. How would you test the following expression (predicate)?



<pre class="brush: java">


  if( (i > 0) || ( i <=0 && x==true )  ){
    
    // Don't worry about what would go here.
    // We're only concerned with the expression above.
  }

</pre>

The entire predicate can be broken down into a number of broad clauses: @i > 0@  and @i <=0 || x==true@. Going a bit further, we can break it down to @i@ and @x@.
