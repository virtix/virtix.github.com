h2. Note to Self



Dear Self,

Tomorrow is soon to be a thing of the past. Yesterday's actions will resonate into the future. Yet, if you ponder in the present moment 
how to manage the past and the future, you'll miss out on the greatest opportunities in life. After all, life _is_ short and our time here is finite. Go and play. 

Love,
Self
