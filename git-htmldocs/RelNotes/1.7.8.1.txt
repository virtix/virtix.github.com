Git v1.7.8.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.8.1
--------------------

 * In some codepaths (notably, checkout and merge), the ignore patterns
   recorded in $GIT_DIR/info/exclude were not honored. They now are.

 * After fetching from a remote that has very long refname, the reporting
   output could have corrupted by overrunning a static buffer.

 * "git checkout" and "git merge" treated in-tree .gitignore and exclude
   file in $GIT_DIR/info/ directory inconsistently when deciding which
   untracked files are ignored and expendable.

Also contains minor fixes and documentation updates.
